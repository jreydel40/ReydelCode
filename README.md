This is a group of example code from school projects, my summer with the Vermont Mountaineers in 2023, and my summer with the Oakland A's in 2024

The school projects include looking at Spotify Data for song recommendations, Zillow Housing Data, MBTA Commuter Rail Data, NASA Asteroids, Building some SQL Databases, and WWII Bombing Missions.

The Mountaineers projects are mostly creating internal pitching and hitting reports, opposition advanced scouting reports through Synergy, working on catcher framing models and umpire reports

The A's Projects Include the Kirby Command Index, Pitch Overlaps for tunneling, Minor and Major League Hitting Projections, Predicting the probability of a called strike for certain pitches.
